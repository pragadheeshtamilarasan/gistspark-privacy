    <h1>ðŸ”’ GistSpark Privacy Policy</h1>
    
    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Simple Summary:</strong> GistSpark doesn't collect, store, or share any of your personal data. Your API keys stay on your device, and we don't track you.
    </div>
    
    <h2>Information We Don't Collect</h2>
    <p>GistSpark is designed with privacy as a core principle. We do not collect, store, transmit, or share:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Personal information or identifiers</li>
        <li>Browsing history or website data</li>
        <li>API keys or credentials</li>
        <li>Content you summarize</li>
        <li>Usage analytics or tracking data</li>
        <li>Cookies or similar tracking technologies</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>How Your Data is Handled</h2>
    <p><strong>API Keys:</strong> Your API keys are stored locally in your browser using Chrome's secure storage. They never leave your device except to authenticate with your chosen AI provider (OpenAI, etc.).</p>
    
    <p><strong>Content Processing:</strong> When you summarize content, the webpage text is sent directly from your browser to your chosen AI provider (OpenAI, Groq, local LLM, etc.). GistSpark acts as a passthrough and never stores or processes this content.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Local Storage Only:</strong> All extension settings and preferences are stored locally on your device using Chrome's sync storage.</p>
    
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>GistSpark integrates with AI providers you choose (OpenAI, Groq, local LLMs). When you use these services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Content is sent directly to your chosen provider for processing</li>
        <li>Each provider has their own privacy policy</li>
        <li>GistSpark doesn't control how these providers handle data</li>
        <li>You can use local LLMs for complete privacy</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>No Analytics or Tracking</h2>
    <p>GistSpark does not use:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Google Analytics or similar services</li>
        <li>Error tracking or crash reporting</li>
        <li>Usage metrics or behavioral analysis</li>
        <li>Advertising networks or trackers</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>GistSpark does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. Since we don't collect any personal information from users of any age, this policy applies universally.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since we don't collect or store personal data, there's no central database that could be compromised. Your API keys are secured by Chrome's built-in encryption and sync mechanisms.</p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>If we update this privacy policy, we'll post the new version here and update the "Last Updated" date below. Since we don't collect contact information, we can't notify users directly of changes.</p>
